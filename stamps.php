These 32 cent stamps were released on April 4, 2002. The retro design of these stamps resembles the large letter postcards that were popular in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>

The First Day Ceremony took place at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and was attended by thousands. At the ceremony, attendees could attach the Duke stamp to an envelope and get it canceled with a First Day of Issue postmark. These postage stamps are very collectable.</p>
