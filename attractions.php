Also,  there are many cultural and historic attractions you can visit, such as   Pearl  Harbor, the Bishop Museum, the Polynesian Cultural Center, etc.).</p>

              <p><strong>Hawaii's Best Natural Attractions</strong></p>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Big   Island of Hawaii</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/hawaii_volcanoes_national_park2.jpg" alt="Hawaii Volcanoes" align="right" /><a href="big-island/attractions/hawaiivolcanoesnationalpark.php">Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</a> on the   Big Island of Hawaii  is the most popular attraction in Hawaii. Each year millions of   travelers from  around the world come here to see active lava flows. This is where you   can observe  one of the most active volcanoes in the world - Kilauea. The national   park is  huge and you need at least a day to explore it. Helicopter tours above   the  volcano are also offered from where you can get a unique perspective of   the  park.</p>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Haleakala National Park, Maui</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/haleakala_national_park2.jpg" alt="Haleakala" align="left" /><a href="maui/attractions/haleakala-national-park.php">Haleakala National Park</a> on Maui is the   largest dormant  volcano in the world. The major attraction here is Haleakala Crater,   featuring  moon-line surroundings. Visitors come to the park for sightseeing,   hiking and  biking. One of the most popular activities is the early morning sunrise  watching. The park is also home to a unique plant - the silversword. It   grows  nowhere else in the world.</p> <?php
show_widgets('','https://www.to-hawaii.com/vacation-rentals.php','rating_desc');
?> <p class="subtitle"><strong>Diamond Head Crater,  Oahu</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/diamond_head.jpg" alt="Diamond Head" align="right" />This is Waikiki's most popular   landmark. It has been  featured on numerous postcards, pictures and wall calendars. Located at   the  eastern end of Waikiki, <a href="oahu/attractions/diamondhead.php">Diamond Head</a> is a hiking destination for many   visitors.  A trail leads to a lookout point from where you can see a large portion   of  Oahu's south shore, including Waikiki and other Honolulu neighborhoods.</p>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Na Pali Coast, Kauai</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/na_pali_coast.jpg" alt="Na Pali Coast" align="left" />Also known as Kauai's crown jewel, the <a href="kauai/attractions/napalicoaststatepark.php">Na Pali Coast</a> is one  of the most spectacular stretches of coastline in the world. Here, tall   sea  cliffs drop vertically into the ocean. A hiking trail leads from Ke'e   Beach all  the way to Kalalau Beach, an 11-mile (17.7 km) adventure that requires   at least  one overnight stop for most hikers. Offshore, tour boats take people to  snorkeling locations and on sea cave explorations. Above, helicopters   soar over  the cliffs for a unique bird's eye view.</p>
              
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Waimea Canyon, Kauai</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/waimea_canyon.jpg" alt="Waimea Canyon" align="right" /><a href="kauai/attractions/waimeacanyon.php">Waimea Canyon</a>, nicknamed the "Grand   Canyon of the Pacific,"  is a majestic chasm in the center of Kauai. One wouldn't think that a   small  island like Kauai could be home to such an amazing crater. It's a  photographer's and hiker's paradise. On a sunny day and especially   during  sunrise and sunset the cliffs shine in a variety of red and orange   colors,  changing with the light. There are several great lookout points along   the road.</p>
              <? include ("theme/text-2.html") ?>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Oheo Gulch, Maui</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/oheo_gulch.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Oheo Gulch" align="left" /><a href="maui/attractions/oheogulch.php">Oheo Gulch</a>, also known as the Seven   Sacred Pools, is one of  the main destinations along the popular Hana Highway. Located just south   of the  sleepy little town of Hana, the gulch is a collection of several pools  (actually there are more than seven) that are fed by a few waterfalls   and empty  into the ocean several feet below. Some people like to swim in these   freshwater  pools because they are refreshing, but this is only recommended if the   weather  is dry because of the danger of flash floods.</p>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Mauna Kea Summit, Big Island</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/mauna_kea.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Mauna Kea" align="right" />At 13,796 feet (4,205 m), <a href="big-island/attractions/maunakeaobservatoriesandsummit.php">Mauna Kea</a> is   the tallest peak in  the Pacific and by some even the tallest in the world when measured from   its  base, which is 18,000 feet (5,486 m) below the ocean's surface. The   summit is  one of the best locations in the world for stargazing. A few world-class  observatories are located here, and astronomers from around the world   book  months in advance to take a peak through these phenomenal telescopes.   Tours to  the summit are being offered, or you can drive yourself, but only   four-wheel  drive vehicles are allowed on the road. But if you don't know how to   navigate a  steep, rough, narrow and unpaved road, it is better to join a tour group   and  let someone else do the driving.</p>           
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Garden of the Gods, Lanai</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/garden_of_gods.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Garden of the Gods" align="left" />These unique rock formations surrounded   by red soil offer an  almost otherworldly view. Also known as Keahikawelo, the <a href="lanai/attractions/gardenofgods.php">Garden of the Gods</a> features   many  large and small boulders that look especially amazing on a sunny day   when they  are shining in a spectrum of orange, red and earthen colors. One legend   tells  how these rocks fell down from the gods' gardens in the sky, hence its   name.  Another legend says that the rocks are holding the spirits of ancient   Hawaiian  warriors. </p>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>Molokai Sea Cliffs</strong></p>
              <p><img src="images/attractions/molokai_sea_cliffs.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Molokai Sea Cliffs" align="right" />The sea cliffs on Molokai's north shore   are the tallest in  the world, dropping about 3,000 feet (914 m) into the Pacific Ocean. If  you've seen the movie Jurassic Park III, these cliffs may look familiar   to you  because they were featured in the movie. What makes this area special is   its  remoteness and grandeur views. Few people have ever seen this amazing   stretch  of coastline. No public boat cruises are being offered. The only way to   see it  is via helicopter or a visit to the <a href="molokai/attractions/kalaupapanationalpark.php">Kalaupapa Peninsula</a>, which is   accessible  via a steep trail (but one can only visit if one joins a tour group   because the  peninsula is a former Hansen's disease settlement, where a few patients   reside  up until today).</p>
