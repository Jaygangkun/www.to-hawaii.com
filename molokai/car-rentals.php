              <h2>Molokai Transportation Tips</h2>
<p>One of the best things about Molokai is that it gives people the chance to experience what it is like be far, far away from the noise of a city. It is a place where you can turn off your mobile phone, shut down the laptop and enjoy the beauty of nature.
<p>Molokai is only 38 miles (61 km) long and has some of the most remote roads in the Hawaiian Islands. Public transportation is not available. The best way to get around and see the island is by renting a car. The car rental options are limited as well, so it is best to reserve in advance.</p>
<p>Car rental companies on Molokai include Alamo Rent a Car, Budget, Island Kine Auto Rentals and Discount Hawaii Car Rental. The car rental companies are located right at the Molokai Airport.</p>
<p>Getting behind the wheel on Molokai is a breeze. There are no traffic lights or traffic jams. Also, it is easy to navigate around Molokai even for first-time visitors. There is only one major highway and smaller roads lead from it to nearby destinations. Some of the roads on Molokai are only accessible with a four-wheel drive vehicle. You can ask the car rental companies for advice.</p>
<p>Driving on Molokai reflects the lifestyle of the island. It is more relaxed than in other places. A sign at the airport reminds visitors of the local driving culture. It says, &ldquo;Slow down, you're on Molokai!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If driving doesn't appeal to you, you can arrange for a taxi or a tour service to get around the island. Contact Molokai Off-Road Tours and Taxi at (808) 553-3369 for taxi services, an airport shuttle or island tour.</p>
<p>For an even slower way to see the sights of the island, mopeds and bicycles can be rented as well.</p>
