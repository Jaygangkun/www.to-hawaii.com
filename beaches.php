                <p>Hawaii's beaches are some of the most diverse in the world. Here  you can find beaches with white sand, black sand, red sand and even green sand,  as well as rocky beaches. Plus, there is even a glass beach on the island of  Kauai, a beach with millions of small pieces of so-called sea glass. </p>
                <p>With so many beaches along its coastline, a large variety of  water activities are possible, including swimming, snorkeling, diving,  bodyboarding, surfing, stand-up paddleboarding, windsurfing, kite surfing,  kayaking, boating and parasailing. Each beach has something unique to offer. </p>
                <p>Here is an overview of some of Hawaii's best beaches, even  though <em>best</em> is a very relative word,  and any beach could be considered the best, depending what you are looking for  and what your definition of a dream beach is. </p>

                <p><strong>Best Hawaii Beaches</strong></p>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Waikiki Beach, Oahu</strong></p>
                <p><a href="oahu/beaches/waikiki-beach.php">Waikiki Beach</a> is the most  popular beach in Hawaii. It is where most Hawaii vacationers choose to stay. Located  on the island of Oahu, it has something for everyone. <span class="subtitle"><strong><a href="oahu/beaches/waikiki-beach.php"><img src="images/beaches/waikiki_beach.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Waikiki Beach" align="left" /></a></strong></span>Surfers gather offshore  at the edge of the reef to ride Waikiki's popular waves. A little further out,  catamarans and sailboats cruise along the coastline.</p>
                <p>Several protected swimming areas and lagoons on the beach  are the perfect playground for children. Along the beach are several equipment  rental stands providing surfboards, bodyboards, fins and snorkels. Even small  boats can be rented. Waikiki Beach is one of the few beaches in Hawaii where  you can find many hotels, restaurants and shops within walking distance.</p> <?php

?> <p class="subtitle"><strong>Hanauma Bay, Oahu</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/hanauma_bay2.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Hanauma Bay" align="right" /><a href="oahu/beaches/hanaumabaypreserve.php">Hanauma Bay</a> is Oahu's most popular snorkeling beach. The bay  is home to over 450 species of fish, some of which can be found nowhere else in  the world. Spend a day here and explore the underwater wonders of this sunken  volcanic crater. When the sun is shining, the coral reef glitters in a rainbow  of colors. Because Hanauma Bay is a nature preserve, volunteers are working  here to protect the bay for generations to come. All visitors will watch a  9-minute film before entering the bay to learn about what they can do to help  protect this natural wonder. There is also a small museum at the visitor center  that provides information about the bay's inhabitants and the coral reef. </p>
                                <p class="subtitle"><strong><img src="images/beaches/tunnels_beach.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Tunnels Beach" align="left" />Tunnels Beach, Kauai</strong></p>
                <p><a href="kauai/beaches/tunnelsbeach.php">Tunnels Beach</a> is one of the best snorkeling and diving  beaches on Kauai. Located on the island's north shore, the beach is known for  its large coral reef, arches and tunnels that gave the beach its name. From the  beach one can see Bali Hai, the mountain that was made famous in the movie <em>South Pacific</em> where it was portrayed as  a forbidden island.</p>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Hanalei Bay, Kauai</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/hanalei_bay.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Hanalei Bay" align="right" />This crescent-shaped bay, with its crystal clear and azure  blue waters has a long white-sand beach that is ideal for a beach stroll. <a href="kauai/beaches/hanaleibay.php">Hanalei Bay</a> is backed by Kauai's green mountains, which are frequently capped by rain clouds  that produce large waterfalls that are visible from the beach.</p>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Ka'anapali Beach</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/kaanapali_beach.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Kaanapali Beach" align="left" /><a href="maui/beaches/kaanapali-beach.php">Ka'anapali Beach</a> is one of Maui's most visited beaches. This  long, sandy stretch of coastline is divided in half by Black Rock, also known  as Pu'u Keka'a in the Hawaiian language. The area in front of the rock offers great  snorkeling conditions.</p>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Napili Bay, Maui</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/napili_bay.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Napili Bay" align="right" />Located on Maui's northwestern shore, <a href="maui/beaches/napilibaybeach.php">Napili Bay</a> is a  favorite among local residents and visitors alike. The nearshore ocean bottom  is sandy and the swimming and snorkeling conditions are good in the summer  months when the ocean is usually calm. In the winter, it's a great beach for  surfing and bodyboarding.</p>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Kealakekua Bay, Big Island</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/kealakekua_bay.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Kealakekua Bay" align="left" /><a href="big-island/beaches/kealakekua-bay.php">Kealakekua Bay</a> is known as an excellent snorkeling and  diving location. Many tour boats can be seen in the bay every day and  snorkelers and divers are busy exploring the many underwater arches, lava tubes  and corals. The bay is also a historic location because it was here where  English explorer Captain James Cook first arrived on the Big Island of Hawaii  in January 1779.</p>
                <? include ("theme/text-2.html") ?>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Hapuna Beach, Big Island</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/hapuna_beach_park.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Hapuna Beach" align="right" />White-sand beaches are rare on the Big Island of Hawaii, but  this is one of the few best. <a href="big-island/beaches/hapunabeachstatepark.php">Hapuna Beach</a> has repeatedly been voted the best  beach in the United States by <em>Conde Nast  Traveller</em>, a travel magazine. The beach is backed by a nicely landscaped  park, palm trees and public facilities.</p>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Hulopo'e Bay, Lanai</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/hulopoe_bay_beach.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Hulopo'e Bay" align="left" /><a href="lanai/beaches/hulopoe-beach.php">Hulopo'e Bay</a> is the best swimming beach on the island of  Lanai. The curved, sandy beach is also a nice place for a picnic. Tables and  BBQ grills are located right on the beach. Because the bay is in a marine life  conservation district, many tropical fish, turtles and dolphins can be observed  here. </p>
                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Papohaku Beach, Molokai</strong></p>
                <p><img src="images/beaches/papohaku_beach2.jpg" width="148" height="125" alt="Papohaku Beach" align="right" /><a href="molokai/beaches/papohaku-beach.php">Papohaku Beach</a> is one of the longest uninterrupted sandy beaches  in Hawaii, stretching over two miles (3.2 km). Located on Molokai's west shore,  it is the prefect place for the ultimate beach stroll, as well as a great place  to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet because not many people come to visit  this beach.</p>
