1. About this plugin

   The development of this plugin started when Google released a document
   called "Google's Search Engine Optimization starter guide" in Nov 2008.
   After a long public beta phase the plugin finally reached stable status
   in March 2009.

   The goal of this plugin is to implement SEO in MyBB according to the
   guidelines presented in Google's SEO starter guide, to make MyBB more
   friendly to both users and search engines.

   This plugin requires Apache with mod_rewrite, MySQL, PHP with mbstring,
   and MyBB 1.4 with UTF-8 encoding. MySQL 5, PHP 5 is highly recommended.
   Unfortunately, one core file has to be modified to make SEO URLs work.

   This plugin is free open source software (GPL). This means that you can
   download the plugin for free, modify it to your liking, and you do not
   have to put any copyright or backlinks on your page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Features

   The plugin currently supports the following features:

   - Google SEO 404:
     * error pages return 404 error code instead of 200
     * add Google's 404 widget to 404 error pages
     * custom 404 error pages

   - Google SEO Meta:
     * generate description meta tags for forums / threads / etc.
     * specify canonical pages

   - Google SEO Redirect:
     * redirect old URLs to new URLs
     * this avoids URL breakage and double content

   - Google SEO Sitemap:
     * dynamic generation of XML Sitemaps
     * search engines find your content without crawling

   - Google SEO URL:
     * replace standard id based URLs (e.g. showthread.php?tid=12345)
       with name based URLs (e.g. Thread-some-subject)
     * UTF-8 in URLs is supported
     * uniquifier is applied for non-unique URLs (see Additional Comments)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Installation instructions

   Upload google_seo.php, google_seo.txt and the google_seo folder
   to inc/plugins of your MyBB installation.

   If you are a new user, you can then install and activate the plugin
   in your Admin CP. If you are upgrading from an old version, do not
   uninstall (Google SEO would lose its data and settings), instead just
   deactivate and activate the plugin once.

   The plugin will display a status information on the plugins page,
   informing you about changes you have to make or potential problems.
   You can enable Google SEO features in the Google SEO setting groups,
   and then check if everything is all right on the plugins page.

   Several features require you to make changes to MyBB. The status
   information on the plugins page will notify you of these, once you
   enable the features. The changes have to be applied manually.

   - Google SEO 404:

     For custom errorpages to work, you have to add the following
     to your .htaccess

       ErrorDocument 404 /MyBB/misc.php?google_seo_error=404

     This will cause 404 errors outside of MyBB show up as MyBB
     error messages, using your boards layout. Please note that
     Google SEO 404 has to be enabled in your configuration first.

   - Google SEO Sitemap:

     Add this rewrite rule to your .htaccess:

       RewriteRule ^sitemap-([^./]+)\.xml$ misc.php?google_seo_sitemap=$1 [L,QSA,NC]

     Tell search engines about your sitemap (e.g. Google Webmaster Tools).
     You can also add this line to your robots.txt:

       Sitemap: http://yoursite/mybb/sitemap-index.xml

   - Google SEO URL:

     Add these rewrite rules to your .htaccess:

       RewriteRule ^Forum-([^./]+)$ forumdisplay.php?google_seo_forum=$1 [L,QSA,NC]
       RewriteRule ^Thread-([^./]+)$ showthread.php?google_seo_thread=$1 [L,QSA,NC]
       RewriteRule ^Announcement-([^./]+)$ announcements.php?google_seo_announcement=$1 [L,QSA,NC]
       RewriteRule ^User-([^./]+)$ member.php?action=profile&google_seo_user=$1 [L,QSA,NC]
       RewriteRule ^Calendar-([^./]+)$ calendar.php?google_seo_calendar=$1 [L,QSA,NC]
       RewriteRule ^Event-([^./]+)$ calendar.php?action=event&google_seo_event=$1 [L,QSA,NC]

     You will also need modify inc/functions.php.

     For your convenience, modified versions of functions.php as well as a patch file
     which may also work for future versions are included with this plugin.

     If you prefer, you can also apply the changes manually:

4. Uninstalling instructions

   If you want to redirect Google SEO URLs back to stock MyBB URLs,
   just upload the original, unmodified inc/functions.php, but make
   sure to keep Google SEO URL and Google SEO Redirect enabled.

   This way Google SEO stays installed and will continue to translate
   page names to IDs, allowing Google SEO Redirect to redirect the
   Google SEO URLs back to stock MyBB URLs.

   This gives users and search engines time to adapt to the change.

   To uninstall completely, undo all the changes you made on install,
   then go to Admin CP -> Plugins and click 'Deactivate'.

   This way the Google SEO URLs will end up in 404 error land.

   If you click 'Uninstall' all data regarding Google SEO URLs will
   be lost. Old URLs for renamed threads / forums will no longer be
   known when you reinstall.

5. Additional comments

   Uniquifier:

     The Google SEO URL uniquifier is applied to URLs that would otherwise
     not be unique (and thus result in threads that are not accessible).
     Collision testing (for example for two threads with the same title)
     is done only once, therefore the uniquifier must result in a truly
     unique URL that can not possibly collide with anything else.

     A good uniquifier needs to fulfill these two criteria:

       1) contain the items unique {$id}
       2) contain punctuation that cannot occur in non-uniquified URLs

     Early versions of Google SEO used {$url}-{$id} as uniquifier and
     therefore did not fulfill criteria 2). This could lead to collisions
     in rare cases, for example:

       ID: 1, Title: Unique, URL: Thread-Unique
       ID: 2, Title: Unique 3, URL: Thread-Unique-3
       ID: 3, Title: Unique, URL: Thread-Unique-3 (same as Thread 2)

     Thread 3 collides with Thread 1 (both are called Unique), so the
     uniquifier is applied. This results in Unique-3. However, there
     already happens to be a thread called Unique-3. Doesn't work.

     With the new uniquifier {$url}{$separator}{$separator}{$id},
     the uniquified URL will be Thread-Unique--3. Because the id is
     already unique, and other URLs can't contain -- (title punctuation
     is reduced to one single separator, not two), that makes the URL
     as a whole unique.

     If you use a custom uniquifier, make sure it fulfills the two
     criteria listed above. Be aware that special punctuation characters
     like :@/?& or space can break your URLs.

   Character Translation:

     Please note that translation of characters is not required (browsers
     and Google handle them just fine), and it causes additional CPU cost.

     You can do character translation in URLs if you so desire. For this
     to work, you have to create a inc/plugins/google_seo/translate.php
     that defines which characters you want translated. This plugin ships
     with several example files, for example translate.php.german for
     the translation of German umlauts.

     The translate.php file must use the UTF-8 encoding.

   XML Sitemap:

     The sitemap standard (or that what Google, Yahoo, Ask etc. are using)
     is described here:

       http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php

     The sitemap-index.xml is an Sitemap index file as described there.
     It links to the actual sitemap files (sitemap-threads.xml?page=1).

     Google SEO Sitemaps are created dynamically. When you tell Google about
     your XML Sitemap (in Google Webmaster Tools, or by specifying it in
     your robots.txt file) it will download the index, and then browse through
     the sitemaps listed in this index. So Google goes through your Sitemap
     page by page similar to how a user goes through your forums page by page.

     It's split into pages because creating a sitemap for tens of thousands of
     threads, users and forums all at once would cause too much load.
     Also, sitemaps have a limitation of 50000 items per sitemap.

     The Sitemap is created dynamically in order to give Google and other
     search engines the current up to date status of your forum whenever it
     chooses to access your sitemap. This way Google gets up to date sitemaps
     as early as possible which leads to google accessing your new content it
     found via the sitemap as early as possible which leads to your new content
     getting indexed by Google as early as possible.

     Please note that the Sitemap displays only forums and threads that
     the current user can actually read. So if you see private threads in
     your sitemap, it may be because you're currently logged in as admin,
     and does not mean that Google will see those threads too.

   robots.txt:

     It's a good idea to prevent robots from indexing parts of your page,
     such as the calendar (Google doesn't like calendars because they do
     infinite links into the past and the future), or pages that would
     double content (archive mode), or pages that are just not interesting
     for search engines (rating threads, sending private messages, ...).

     This plugin comes with a robots.txt.example file that you can adapt
     to your needs. You will have to modify this file before using it.

   Title tags:

     Make sure that your template gives a unique title to each page.

     Search for '<title>{$mybb->settings['bbname']} -' in your templates.

     In all occurences, put the bbname last.

     Example:

       <title>{$mybb->settings['bbname']} - {$foruminfo['name']} </title>

     Should be:

       <title>{$foruminfo['name']} - {$mybb->settings['bbname']}</title>

     Having the bbname in the title on every page is optional. If you
     have a properly named domain you can even leave it out entirely.
     If you decide to keep it, make sure that your template puts it as
     last element in every page title.
