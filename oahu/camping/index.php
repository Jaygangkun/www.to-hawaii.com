              <p>Oahu is the most populous island in the Hawaiian archipelago and most visitors choose Oahu as their vacation destination. There are many hotels and vacation homes and condos all over Oahu, but equally, there are many areas where you can simply pitch your tent and enjoy sleeping under the stars.<br />
                <br />
                If you plan to camp on Oahu, no matter if at a state or county site, you will need to obtain a camping permit in advance. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Camping at a Hawaii state park on Oahu</strong><br />
                <br />
                All state campsites on Oahu are administered by the Hawaii DLNR, State Parks. They prefer that all reservations are made on their online portal, which is located at: www.hawaiistateparks.org/camping/oahu.cfm (see the button &ldquo;Online Reservations&rdquo; in the top left corner on their website). You can make your reservation no more than 30 days in advance (unlike for campsites on the other Hawaiian islands where you can reserve up to one year in advance). There are other special rules that apply for Oahu only. Camping in state parks is not available on Wednesday and Thursday nights, and Sand Island State Park is only open to camping on weekends (Friday through Sunday nights).</p>

              <p>If you plan to stay at a 3-day campground, the fee is $32. The fee for a 5-day campground is $52. These are flat fees. You pay this no matter if you plan to stay for just 1 night or for the entire time (3 or 5 days). The fee is per campsite. Each campsite is for up to 10 people. Camping always begins on Friday starting at 5 pm and extends through the weekend ending on either Monday at 8 am (3 days) or Wednesday at 8 am (5 days).</p>
              <p><strong>Some rules and tips for your camping trip</strong></p>
              <p>Keep in mind that campfires and bonfires are illegal on all public beaches and parks in Hawaii. For cooking you may only use above-ground barbecue grills, but they have to be at least 12 inches off the ground. If you are planning to camp during a holiday weekend, it is a good idea to make your reservation early. You can obtain a permit two Fridays prior to the Friday you want to camp at 5 pm (HST).</p>
