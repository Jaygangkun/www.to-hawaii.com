              <h2>Hawaii Hotels</h2>
              <p><img src="images/p_hawaiihotels.jpg" width="148" height="125" align="right" alt="Hawaii hotels" />Many Hawaii  travelers decide to stay at a hotel.  If that's your plan, you can browse Hawaii hotels  and compare rates on different travel sites at once and find the best deal. </p>

              <p class="subtitle">Pros:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Most of the hotels in Hawaii are located in popular areas, such as Waikiki (on Oahu), Kaanapali, Kihei, Wailea (on Maui), Poipu,       Princeville (on Kauai) and Hilo and Kailua-Kona (on the Big Island of Hawaii), so you will be close to       beaches, shops, restaurants, activities and evening entertainment. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Booking a hotel room in a major tourist area is also good for those who don't plan to rent a car, since restaurants and shops are within easy reach of many hotels.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Depending on the hotel class, hotels come with all kinds of guest services and amenities, such as concierge service, daily maid service, on-site bars and restaurants, pools, fitness center, etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="subtitle">Cons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>At the moment of your hotel booking, you can't see the exact hotel room you will be staying at.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Hotel rooms are sometimes more expensive than condo rentals booked directly from the owner.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Depending on the location, season and popularity of the hotel, it can be crowded and noisy.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Not all hotel accommodations come with kitchens and cooking facilities.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Guests are expected to tip for guest services, such as housekeeping, room service, etc.</li>

              <p>Here are some pros and cons for staying at a vacation  rental:</p>
              <p class="subtitle">Pros:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>There are vacation rentals all over Hawaii, including in remote areas where there are no hotels.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Before you book a vacation rental, you can browse and compare rentals, see images, videos and often times also read reviews from people who have previously stayed there.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Often times you can enjoy more privacy in a vacation rental compared to a hotel room.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Vacation rentals are generally furnished with all amenities you need to be comfortable and to feel like home - fully-equipped kitchen, TV, DVD player, private parking, etc. Many vacation rentals have private pools as well.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Vacation rentals are sometimes larger than a hotel room.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>You save money on guest service tipping.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="subtitle">Cons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>No guest service</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Some vacation rentals are far from shops, entertainment, activities and restaurants.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>It is recommended to rent a car if you plan to stay at a vacation rental that is not located in a tourist area. Many vacation rentals are in areas where there is no or limited public transportation, especially if you are staying on a Hawaiian island other than Oahu.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>You pay a cleaning fee on top of the cost for accommodation.</li>
