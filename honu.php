              <p>There are seven species of sea turtles in  the world, four of which can be found in the Hawaiian  Islands - the green sea turtle, the hawksbill, the leatherback and  the olive ridley. The green sea turtle is the most common species of sea turtle  in Hawaii and  one of the few to have seen numbers rise in recent decades due to conservation  efforts. </p>
              <p>The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) is among  the largest marine turtles. The species is named after the color of its fat, which  is thought to be tinted by its diet. Green sea turtles have been swimming the  oceans for over 200 million years and are one of the few species on Earth to  have lived trough the evolution and extinction of the dinosaurs and ice ages,  roaming the seas before the  Hawaiian Islands even existed. </p>
              <? include ("theme/text.html") ?>
              <p>Hawaiian legend is peppered with stories of  this magnificent creature, including the green sea turtle 'Kauila,' who could  change herself into a girl to watch over the children playing at Punalu'u Beach  on the Big Island. Some sources even claim that people  from the Marquesas, the first humans to travel to the Hawaiian   Islands, were guided by sea turtles. In ancient native drawings,  the green sea turtle is represented by the petroglyphic 'honu.'</p>
              
              <p> In tribal times, chiefs were given the honor of feasting on  the flesh of the sea turtle, and in the years of monarchy, the royal family was  served this delicacy. Nowadays, despite protection from environmental agencies,  millions of these ancient reptiles end up in soup pots worldwide. </p>
              <p> Living to an average of about one hundred years, with a  heart-shaped grey-brown shell up to 3 feet (90 cm) long, green sea turtles  weigh as much as 200-400 pounds (91-181 kg) and are found in tropical and  subtropical waters around the world. Adult green sea turtles are the only  herbivorous sea turtles. When young, they are carnivorous, eating sponges,  snails and crabs, but as adults they eat seaweeds, algae and seagrass. The head  - which, unlike many other species of turtle, green sea turtles are unable to  retract into their shell - is much smaller than other varieties, making their  dark eyes appear even larger. </p> <?php

?> <p> Male green sea turtles are born on land, but spend  virtually their entire lives at sea. Hawaiian beach sightings therefore are  mainly females and juveniles. History plays a huge part in the reproduction  cycle - green sea turtles migrate hundreds of miles to breeding grounds to  mate, and female green sea turtles then travel to the same beaches to nest as  their predecessors. For most Hawaiian turtles, this journey involves a  migration to the quieter shores of the uninhabited Northwestern   Hawaiian Islands, which lie northwest of the main, inhabited  islands of Hawaii.</p>
              <p> The unique nesting ritual of the green sea turtle has  changed very little over millions of years. When the female is ready to hatch,  she waits bobbing the surf until the calm and coolness of evening. At the right  moment she hauls out onto the exposed beach and digs a two-foot (60 cm) deep  hole with her flippers. She then crouches over it and lays her leathery eggs.  During a single season the female green sea turtle might fill three or four  nests with up to 100 eggs in each. After filling the nest with sand, she darts  back to the water, her mission complete for two to three years, when she mates  again. </p>
                             <? include ("theme/text-desktop-only.html") ?>
              <p> However, some of those eggs will not hatch  and not all of the two-inch (5 cm), one-ounce (28 gram) hatchlings will be able  to run through the surf into the freedom of the ocean. Rats, mongooses, fungi,  crabs, dogs and humans pose a danger for the precious eggs. The few babies that  survive have to dig themselves out of the sand and run for life. </p>
              <p>Turtles are quite clumsy when moving on  land, but in the water, they can swim at speeds up to 35 mph (56 km/h). Adult  turtles need to come to the surface of the water to breathe about once every  two hours when at rest. </p>
               
              <p>In the 20th century the green  sea turtle population declined so much that in 1978, it was placed on the Endangered  Species List. In the last few decades, thanks to conservation efforts, the  green sea turtle population has increased. Studies estimate that Hawaii now has  as many as 35,000 mature green sea turtles and perhaps 250,000 juveniles age 6  or under according to George Balazs, a Hawaii marine scientist (Synopsis of Biological Data on the Green Turtle in  the Hawaiian Islands, NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFC-7, 1980).</p>
              <p>Today, Hawaiian green sea turtles (as well  as other turtle species in Hawaii)  enjoy full protection under the federal Endangered Species Act and under Hawaii state law. It is  prohibited to hunt, handle, injure or harass green sea turtles or holding them  in captivity without a special permit for research or educational purposes.  Furthermore, swimmers should keep in mind that touching, riding or chasing a  sea turtle is illegal. Fines can be as high as $100,000 and include some time  in prison.</p>
