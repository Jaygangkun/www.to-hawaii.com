              <p><strong>Getting Married in Hawaii</strong></p>
              <p>Countless couples with visions of "happily ever after" come to the Hawaiian Islands to start their new lives together in paradise. Saying "I Do" just may be the most important two words you'll utter in your lifetime. And what better backdrop to celebrate this union than in Hawaii? The mild and sunny year-round Hawaiian climate, the spiritual power of the ocean and the awe-inspiring lush scenes of Hawaii help to create a memorable and profound wedding experience. Many couples married in Hawaii return annually, or during big anniversaries, to renew their vows and celebrate their life together. </p>
            
              <p>The wedding options in Hawaii are diverse and plentiful. From the simple to the sublime, any type of creative celebration can take place here. Choose either formal attire or casual island-style attire, or go completely casual in your bathing suits and  slippers (flip flops)! Arrange a fresh
                flower lei exchange and symbolically adorn the parents of the bride and groom during the ceremony. Original music, tropical flowers, beachside ceremonies... whatever your vision may be, the Islands can accommodate. Hawaii is a relatively easy location for getting married. There's very little red tape and no waiting period. </p>  <? include ("theme/text.html") ?>
              <p><strong>Hawaii Marriage License</strong></p>
              <p>The happy couple must obtain a state license to legitimize their union. It is recommended that you apply for your marriage license about a month prior to your ceremony. As soon as the license is issued, a ceremony may take place. You'll need to have birth certificates and other proof of identification documents, tax information and a few other important documents on hand. If you or your partner were previously married, documentation will be required. You will sign the document in the presence of a witness, the official license will be mailed to you, and then 
                you will need to have your marriage performer sign the document on your wedding day.</p> <?php
show_widgets('','https://www.to-hawaii.com/vacation-rentals.php','rating_desc');
?> <p><strong>Hawaii Marriage Certificate</strong></p>
              <p>Once a ceremony has taken place, a marriage certificate must be signed to show the union is complete and officiated. Your chaplain or ceremony performer will prepare the document and file the signed certificate with the Department of Health. Newly married couples will receive a copy of the certificate. </p>
              <p><strong>Marriage Performer</strong></p>
              <p>You must choose a person to perform your ceremony who is licensed in the state of Hawaii. For further information about obtaining a marriage performer, you can visit the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hvcb.org">www.hvcb.org</a>.</p>

              <p>Same-sex marriage is legal in Hawaii since December 2, 2013. Governor Neil Abercrombie signed the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act, also known as Hawaii Senate Bill 1 (SB1) on November 13, which allows same-sex couples to legally wed in the state. Both same-sex and opposite-sex couples also have the option to formalize their relationships legally in the form of civil unions and reciprocal beneficiary relationships. While Hawaii civil unions provide the same rights and obligations of marriage at the state level, reciprocal relationships offer only limited rights. In addition to the state of Hawaii now allowing and recognizing same-sex marriages, the U.S. federal government is doing so as well (the federal government started recognizing same-sex marriages after the Supreme Court overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on June 28, 2013).</p>
