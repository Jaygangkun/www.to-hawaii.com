              <h2>Riding a horse in Hawaii</h2>
              <p>Horseback riding is a great way to get close to nature and explore the Islands at a slow pace. Horseback tour providers in Hawaii welcome both experienced and first-time riders. Usually a horseback riding tour is about one hour long. There are two-hour, three-hour and even longer tours as well. To guarantee the satisfaction of their customers, the horseback tour companies organize tours in small groups (private tours are offered as well). An experienced tour guide leads the group and can assist first-time riders. Stops are made at scenic points; so take your camera with you because you will have the chance to take plenty of pictures. </p> <?php
show_widgets('','https://www.to-hawaii.com/vacation-rentals.php','rating_desc');
?> <p>Before you book your horseback riding tour, check if your tour company has any restrictions. Some of the companies have age, height and weight restrictions you should be aware of before you book your tour. It's also recommended that you wear closed-toed shoes and long pants. The horses are usually friendly and well-mannered. So don't be afraid to get on the horse if you are a novice. Your tour guide will provide you with clear instructions before the ride. At some stables you can even get a private horseback lesson if you want to.</p>
