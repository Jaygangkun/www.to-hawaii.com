                <p>One of the special features of spa  treatments in Hawaii  is the use of natural ingredients found locally on the islands. Many spas will  make use of tropical fruits, such as banana, pineapple and coconut, plants such  as ti leaves, and oils made from local kukui or macadamia nuts, avocadoes and  olives. Sweet scrubs are on offer using local honey and sugar, and many  essential oils are distilled from native plants and flowers.</p> <?php

?> <p>The treatments themselves also draw on  native aspects and ancient healing arts. The most popular is the lomi lomi  massage, a spiritual massage dating back to ancient Hawaii, used by master healers for not just  physical, but mental and emotional healing as well. This type of massage uses flowing  rhythmic strokes with the forearms and hands, which aims to release both muscle  tension and energy blockages. This treatment can also be performed with steamed  hot lava stones (called a lomi lomi Pohaku massage).</p>
              <? include ("theme/text-desktop-only.html") ?>
                <p>The influence of Hawaiian landscapes is  often present in local spa treatments. Face masks employ blended sea enzymes,  body wraps can include native red clay or Hawaiian noni berries, seaweed is used  in detoxifying treatments, and herb-soaked hot towels are used for a relaxing,  natural cleanse. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Spa treatments are available on most of Hawaii&rsquo;s eight main  islands, with both luxurious five-star spas and smaller, locally-owned businesses.  Day spas are often less expensive than resort spas, and many hotel and  independent spas will allow you to enjoy your treatment outdoors, where you can  take advantage of the state&rsquo;s tropical climate with a view of the ocean. </p>
