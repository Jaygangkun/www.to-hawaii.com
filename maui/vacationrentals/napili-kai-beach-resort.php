              <p>The Napili Beach Resort is located on 10 beachfront acres in West  Maui.  There are 163 hotel rooms and condos to choose from.  These range from standard hotel rooms or studios sleeping up to three guests to  two-bedroom condo suites which can accommodate between four and seven people.  All units have a private  lanai, coffee makers and refrigerators. The larger  condos come with fully-equipped kitchens.</p>

              <p> Outside of the  accommodations, the great thing about the Napili Kai Beach Resort is its  location, something its very own Sea House Restaurant certainly makes the most  of. Situated directly on the beach, the Sea House offers breakfast, lunch and  dinner. Winner of the Maui Magazine's 2010  'Aipono Award for &quot;Best Kept Secret,&quot; the Sea House offers a  special sunset three-course menu. For after  dinner the Sea House Bar and Terrace allows guests to stay right at the water's  edge to enjoy the evening. For daytime dining the Makai Hale snack bar serves  up snacks and lunch  adjacent to the resort's main pool.</p>

              <p> This pool is actually one of four within  the resort, provided alongside a large spa tub. For those who prefer to swim  on the beautiful white-sand beach, free beach gear can be picked up from the  poolside snack bar. The resort also offers weekly activities for guests looking to  experience Hawaiian culture. These include a complimentary Mai Tai  party along with hula dance classes and lei making sessions. Impressively, the  year-round kids club is also provided free of charge, while adults may wish to  practice skills on the 18-hole putting green or one of the two shuffleboard  courts. A fitness room is also available.</p>

              <p> Meeting  space is provided at the Napili  Beach Resort by either the Lani Pool Deck or the Aloha Pavilion. The former caters  for between 20 and 80 guests, whilst the latter provides space for up to 250.  Private dining can also be provided in the Sea House Restaurant for up to 20  guests, and catering can be arranged for larger parties.</p>
