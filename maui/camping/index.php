              <p>Those who love the great outdoors will not be disappointed on Maui, a haven for campers who want to experience a diverse range of terrains. Adventure is the name of the game, with options from camping inside a volcanic crater, in the lush rainforest, or on a tropical beach.</p>

              <p><strong>Camping at a Hawaii state park on Maui</strong></p>
              <p>All state camping areas are administered by the Hawaii DLNR, State Parks. They prefer that all reservations are made on their online portal, which is located at: www.hawaiistateparks.org/camping/maui.cfm (see the button &ldquo;Online Reservations&rdquo; in the top left corner on their website). You can make your reservation up to one year in advance. </p>
