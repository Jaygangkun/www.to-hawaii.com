              <p>The daughter of legendary Don Ho has learned to fly on her own. After singing together with her father for years and stealing the spotlight from him more than once with her pure and powerful voice, she has made a career in the music business all on her own. At the age of 18, she released her first album <em>Another Dumb Blonde</em>, soon followed by her second release <em>Hoku</em>.</p> <?php

              <p>Hoku, whose name means &ldquo;star&rdquo; in English, has been compared to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. However, she prefers to be seen as the girl next door and does not want to build an image as a sexy blonde kitten type. Her hit song <em>Perfect Day</em> was the title song to the movie <em>Legally Blonde</em> with Reese Witherspoon.</p>
