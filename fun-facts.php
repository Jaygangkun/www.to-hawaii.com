              <p>Hawaii is the most isolated  population center on Earth. It is 2,390 miles (3,846 km) from California, 3,850 miles (6,196 km) from Japan and 4,900 miles (7,886 km) from China.</p>
              <p>The state of Hawaii consists of eight larger, populated islands (with the exception of the island of Kahoolawe, which is not populated) and 124 small, uninhabited islands, reefs and atolls stretching from Nihoa, located about 280 miles (450 km) northwest of Honolulu, all the way to the Kure Atoll, located further northwest.

              <p><strong>Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Fun Facts</strong></p>
              <p>The coral reefs in the <a href="northwesternhawaiianislands.php">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a> make up about 70 percent of all the reefs in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are a National Monument since June 15, 2006, when George W. Bush issued a public proclamation that created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. In 2007, it was renamed to Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea Marine National Monument. The Monument encompasses 140,000 square miles (360,000 square km) of ocean waters, including ten islands and atolls of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, making it the largest marine wildlife reserve in the world. It's about the size of California. </p>
              <p>The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are home to more than 7,000 marine species, a quarter of which are found nowhere else in the world. One such marine species are the approximately 1,400 surviving Hawaiian monk seals, which is the entire population of this endangered species. The archipelago is also the breeding ground for 90 percent of the endangered Hawaiian green sea turtle. It is also home to an estimated 10 million birds, including three endemic species of land birds and 18 species of seabirds.</p>
              <p>Most of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were discovered by accident. Some islands (Maro, Lisianski, Pearl and Hermes, French Frigate and Kure) were named after ships or captains of ships that grounded on the treacherous reefs that surround these islands.</p>
