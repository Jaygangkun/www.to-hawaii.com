              <p>Hawaii is not only a haven for stunning movie scenes - island life has also provided incredible scenery for some very memorable television series. Who can forget the adventures of the cunning and handsome private investigator Thomas Magnum in <em>Magnum P.I.</em>, or the case-cracking abilities of <em>Hawaii Five-O'</em>s Steve McGarrett and "Danno" Williams?</p>
              <? include ("theme/text-2.html") ?>
              <p>Other short run series like <em>Byrds of Paradise</em> (1994), <em>One West Waikiki</em> (1995 - 1996), the <em>Fantasy Island</em> revival series (1998), <em>Soulmates</em> (2001) and <em>Marker</em> (1995) enjoyed a brief, but fun run in the Islands. Also, the short-lived NBC series <em>Hawaii</em> (2004) and Fox's <em>North Shore </em>(2004-2005) entertained audiences briefly. Reality TV also has made its mark on the Islands, with a season of <em>Boarding House: North Shore</em> (2003) featuring pro-surfers, ABC's <em>The Bachelor, The Amazing Race 3, Celebrity Mole Hawaii</em>, 
                WB's <em>High School Reunion 2</em> and MTV's <em>Real World: Hawaii</em> (season 8). Other popular series that were filmed in Hawaii include <em>Gilligan's Island</em> (1964), <em>The Thorn Birds</em> (1983), <em>Fantasy Island</em> (1988) and <em>Baywatch Hawaii</em> (1999-2001).</p>
              <p>Fans of the hit castaway drama <em>Lost </em>(2004-2010) can appreciate the stunning beach shots and island character. <em>The Break</em> is a teen-targeted drama that already has a steady fan base. Many popular series took a "vacation" from their usual sets to film Hawaii episodes, including <em>The Brady Bunch, My Wife &amp; Kids </em>and <em>ER</em>. Hawaii has also been the backdrop for countless concerts, documentaries and educational DVD releases.</p>
                            <p>Debuting some of the most-acclaimed films in history, several film festivals are held annually in Hawaii, including the Hawaii International Film Festival, the Maui Film Festival and the Honolulu Rainbow Film Festival. Films shot in the Hawaiian Islands have grossed millions in box office and rental profits. One thing is for sure - as the most remote island grouping on Earth, a Hawaiian set offers a truly unique movie experience.</p>
