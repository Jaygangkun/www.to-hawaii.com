              <p>His songs, even though they are not traditional Hawaiian, symbolize for many the spirit of Waikiki and conjure up visions of tropical sunsets, grass skirts and coconut bras, Diamond Head in the moonlight and a Mai Tai in hand. One of his most popular songs was <em>Tiny Bubbles</em>. He was often called the &ldquo;Hawaiian Elvis.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Don Ho had also been very active in his private life as the father of ten children. His youngest daughter, Hoku, is a singer herself. Don Ho passed away in 2007 at the age of 76.</p>
