              <h2>Hawaii nature tours and highlights</h2>
              <p>Hawaii nature tours are one of the most popular things to do in Hawaii. You will find a variety of companies on all the Hawaiian islands that offer all kinds of nature and eco tours - hiking tours, bird-watching tours, waterfall tours, volcano tours and  more. Hawaii's nature is rich, vivid and unique. Here you can see spectacular waterfalls cascading down from tall cliffs, lush tropical rainforests and valleys, lava fields and beaches with a variety of colors of sand (white, red, green and black). The following list is a brief compilation of some of the top natural highlights you can discover  in Hawaii. </p>
              <h3>Natural highlights on Oahu</h3>
              <p><strong><img border="0" src="images/diamond-head.jpg" width="148" height="125" align="right" alt="Diamond Head" /><span class="subtitle">Diamond Head:</span></strong> <a href="oahu/attractions/diamondhead.php">Diamond Head</a> is one the most famous landmarks on the island of Oahu. The extinct volcanic crater's  760-foot (231m) summit is the top hiking destintation on the island and for good reason. It's an easy hike and takes about 20 to 50 minutes (depending on your walking speed) to reach the top. From the observation platform you can enjoy panoramic views of Honolulu and Waikiki. On a clear day you can even see all the way to  the neighbor islands of Molokai, Maui and Lanai. In the winter (November through March), you might want to bring binoculars because Diamond Head is also a good spot for whale watching. </p>
              <p>Guided hiking tours that include transportation to Diamond Head are available. Or you can go on your own and take the public bus to get there (with bus number 23 from Waikiki). The admission to the park is $1 per person. It is open from 6 am to 6 pm daily. </p>
                            <? include ("theme/text.html") ?>
              <p><strong><img border="0" src="images/manoa-falls.jpg" width="148" height="125" align="left" alt="Manoa Falls" /><span class="subtitle">Manoa Falls:</span></strong> <a href="oahu/waterfalls/manoafalls.php">Manoa Falls</a> is a 150-foot (45m) waterfall that can be reached only by foot. Located in the Ko'olau Mountains, the hiking trail to the waterfall is just 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long one way. The path is well-maintained but can be muddy if it has recently rained. It is an easy hike, however, it does require climbing over a few large boulders at the end of the trail. It leads through a tropical  rainforest, where you can see a variety of tropical flowers and trees.</p>
              <p>The hike is quite popular. If you prefer to book a guided Manoa Falls hiking tour, you will visit the place together with a small group of other hikers and the tour guide will provide you with information about the location. If you want to go to Manoa Falls on your own, you can take bus number 5, which leaves daily from Ala Moana Shopping Center. You'll have to get off at the last stop. Ask the bus driver for assistance if you're not sure.</p>
              <p><strong><img border="0" src="images/pali-lookout.jpg" width="148" height="125" align="right" alt="Pali Lookout" /><span class="subtitle">Pali Lookout:</span></strong> The <a href="oahu/attractions/nuuanupalilookout.php">Pali Lookout</a> is located on the Pali Highway between Honolulu and Kailua. It overlooks the 985-foot cliffs of the Ko'olau Mountain Range. From up here you'll have a great panoramic ocean and mountain view and you'll be able to see a wide stretch of Oahu's windward coast, with the cities of Kaneohe and Kailua in the distance as well as the small offshore island Chinaman's Hat. The Pali Lookout left a big mark in the history of Hawaii. In 1795, King Kamehameha held his last battle here to unite all islands. Hundreds of warriors died in that battle, and according to some legends, their souls still roam this area. </p>
              <p>The Pali Lookout is open daily from 9 am to 4 pm. There is no admission fee (but parking costs $3 for non-Hawaii residents), so if you drive on the Pali Highway, you may want to stop and spend a few moments here. Tours to the Pali Lookout are also arranged by local companies. Or if you book an Oahu circle island tour, a stop at the Pali Lookout is usually included.</p> <?php

It is surrounded by the cliffs of the dormant volcano Pu'u Kukui and its top is often hidden in the clouds. Besides its natural beauty, Iao Valley is also a historical location. In 1790, it was the site of a dramatic battle held by King Kamehameha I. There is a lookout point one can hike to.  The Iao Valley State Park is open from 7 am to 7 pm daily.</p>
