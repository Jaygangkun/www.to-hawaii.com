  <div style="float:right; width:49%;"> Most 
    of Hawaii's beaches look inviting and for many people, the word &ldquo;beach&rdquo; is equivalent 
    to &ldquo;fun.&rdquo; However, swimming in the ocean is unlike swimming in a pool and especially 
    in Hawaii, powerful shorebreaks, high surf, strong currents and rip tides are 
    common. On average, 60 people die each year by drowning in Hawaii, according 
    to the State of Hawaii Department of Health Injury Prevention and Control Program. 
    The ocean may look calm, but currents, unlike high surf, are difficult to spot. 
    So be cautious when entering the ocean and read and obey all warning signs. 
    They could save your life.
    <p><strong>Beach Safety Tip #1: Choose a beach with a lifeguard</strong><br />
      It is best to swim at guarded beaches. But keep in mind that lifeguards are 
      humans too and they can't watch everyone all the time. Stay within sight and 
      near the shore.</p>
    <p><strong>Beach Safety Tip #2: Pay attention to beach warning signs</strong><br />
      Whenever possible, signs are posted on beaches that warn beachgoers about current 
      dangers, such as strong currents, stinging jellyfish, sharp corals, slippery 
      rocks and other hazards.</p>
    <p><strong>Beach Safety Tip #3: Don't swim at remote beaches</strong><br />
      If you want to swim at a remote beach and notice that no one else is in the 
      water, stay out. There is probably a reason why.</p>
    <p><strong>Beach Safety Tip #4: Never turn your back on the ocean</strong><br />
      Sudden large waves can sneak up on you and sweep you off the beach or rocks 
      and pull you out to deep water without warning.</p>
    <p><strong>Beach Safety Tip #5: If in doubt, don't go out!</strong><br />
      Whenever you're not sure if a beach is safe to swim at, don't enter the ocean. </p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:25px; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00;"> <strong>Rip Currents</strong></p>
<div style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-seri; font-size:12px; line-height:17px; width:100%;">
  <div style="float:left; width:49%;"> <img src="images/ripcurrent.jpg" alt="Rip current" style="width:100%; max-width:400px;"  /></div>
  <div style="float:right; width:49%;"> Most Rip currents are strong, channeled and fast-moving 
    currents of water flowing away from shore. They usually extend from 
    the shoreline and end past the area where the surf breaks. Rip currents 
    can be very dangerous if one gets caught in one and doesn't know what 
    to do. These currents account for many drownings because swimmers caught 
    in a rip get swept out to sea and are unable to return to shore.
    <p> <strong>Here are some safety precautions that you can take:</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Swim at a beach that has lifeguards &ndash; don't swim at remote or 
        unguarded beaches.</li>
      <li>Never swim alone.</li>
      <li>Obey all beach warning signs. </li>
      <li>Ask a lifeguard about the current conditions before entering 
        the water. </li>
      <li>Stay at least 100 feet (30 m) away from jetties and piers. Rip 
        currents often exist alongside these structures.</li>
      <li>Watch for turbulences on the water's surface before going into 
        the ocean. </li>
      <li>If in doubt, don't go out.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What to do if you find yourself in a rip current:</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Keep calm and don't panic.</li>
      <li>Don't fight the current. Don't swim against it.</li>
      <li>Swim parallel to the shoreline and out of the current. When 
        out of the current, swim at an angle towards shore.</li>
      <li>If you are unable to escape, stay calm, tread water or float. 
        Call or wave for help.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>If you see someone caught in a current, don't become a victim 
      too:</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Call a lifeguard. </li>
      <li>If a lifeguard is not present, call 911.</li>
      <li>If possible, throw the rip current victim something that floats 
        &ndash; an inflatable water toy or lifejacket, etc.</li>
      <li>Yell instructions on how to escape. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Final Tip:</strong> The individual beach conditions on all Hawaiian islands are seasonal, meaning that in some months a particular beach can be great for ocean activities, such as swimming, snorkeling, surfing, etc. but in other months these activities may not be possible or may even be hazardous. Always check with the lifeguards before going in the water and use common sense. And remember: &quot;If in doubt, don't go out.&quot;</p>
