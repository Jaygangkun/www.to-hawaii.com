              <p>If you plan to move to Hawaii,  you probably have many questions and want to have them answered before you   move to the islands. Since we live in Hawaii and we know the islands well, we will  provide the answers to some of your questions about moving to Hawaii right here.</p>
              <p><strong>Which island should I move to?</strong></p>
              <p> This is a question that only you can answer. However, we can help you with  some useful information and tips. First of all, if you can afford it, plan a  trip to Hawaii  before you actually move here. Once you have explored the islands and seen them  with your own eyes, you will have a better idea where you would feel most  comfortable and happy to live. Each one of the six islands is unique not just  in geography, but also in the lifestyle they offer, the cost of living,  salaries and job opportunities. But no matter which island you choose, keep in mind that salaries in Hawaii are generally lower than in the continental U.S., even though the cost of living is higher in the islands.</p>
              <? include ("theme/text.html") ?>
              <p> The island of <strong class="subtitle">Oahu</strong>, nicknamed &quot;The Gathering Place,&quot;  is the most populated of the Hawaiian islands (953,207 people as of the 2010 Census). It is where the capital of Honolulu  and world-famous Waikiki are located. Most  people who choose to move to Hawaii  choose Oahu because it has the most job and  entertainment opportunities and higher salaries compared to the other islands. Oahu is the busiest of all Hawaiian   islands and Honolulu  is quite similar to many major American cities with high-rises, busy highways  and traffic jams. Main shopping malls, such as Ala Moana Center, and certain beaches, such as  popular Waikiki Beach and Hanauma Bay,  can be quite crowded on most days of the year. Most jobs on Oahu  are in tourism, government/military, construction, agriculture, retail sales  and healthcare. </p>
              <p> The island of <strong class="subtitle">Maui</strong> is slightly larger in size than Oahu, but only 144,444 (as of 2010) people live  here.  Maui is therefore a lot less crowded. The  variety of jobs available on Maui is smaller  than on Oahu. The two main industries are  tourism and agriculture. Most people would agree that Maui  is a lot less hectic than bustling Oahu, but  not too sleepy to get bored, especially if you live in the Kahului, Lahaina and  Kihei areas.</p> <?php
show_widgets('','https://www.to-hawaii.com/vacation-rentals.php','rating_desc');
?> <p> The <strong class="subtitle">Big Island of Hawaii</strong>, as its name implies, is the largest of the Hawaiian islands. It has a population of 185,079 (as of  2010) and like Maui, tourism is the  island's main industry, centered mainly on the west shore of the island  (Kona Coast). Other main industries include agriculture (such as macadamia  nuts, orchids and Kona coffee), cattle ranching and astronomy.</p>
				              <p> The island of <strong class="subtitle">Kauai</strong> has a population of 66,921 (as of  2010) and like on the other islands, tourism is its main economy, followed by  government and retail. The islands of <strong class="subtitle">Molokai</strong> and <strong class="subtitle">Lanai</strong> are the most difficult when it comes  to finding a job, but what they do provide is solitude. Molokai's  population is just 7,345 (as of 2010) and Lanai's  population is 3,135 (as of 2010). Molokai has  the state's highest unemployment rate at 5.6% (as of March 2017). On Lanai,  most people work at either one of the island's two luxury  hotels, the Four Seasons Resort Lanai and the Four Seasons Lodge at Koele.  So you either are lucky and get one of those jobs in the hotel industry or move off-island. Life on Kauai, Molokai  and Lanai is very laid-back and the nighttime  entertainment options are very limited. But if you're looking for peace and quiet,  you'll find it here.</p>
              <p> The best time to arrive in Hawaii  is between January and May and between September and November. During these  times, fewer tourists come to the island, so affordable flights, car  rentals and <a href="https://www.to-hawaii.com/vacation-rentals.php">Hawaii short-term accommodations</a> are easier to find. </p>
              <p><strong>What to bring?</strong></p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Personal belongings: </strong>It is  best to bring as few belongings as possible. Here in Hawaii you can find a  furnished place with all the necessary equipment for living. Therefore, it  won't be necessary to bring cooking pots, silverware, furniture, etc. Bring  your personal keepsakes and clothes. You will need T-shirts, shorts, a light  jacket and jeans. If you need more clothes there are plenty of choices when it comes to clothing stores, from affordable (such as Ross Dress for Less) to upscale boutiques (such as Gucci and Prada). </p>
              <p> Make sure you bring all your important documents with you, including ID,  personal papers, medical records, prescriptions, etc. Keep these documents in a  safe place in your carry-on luggage. </p>
                            <? include ("theme/text-2.html") ?>
              <p> If you have too much stuff you want to bring to the islands, you may ask a  friend to help you. Have some of your friends ship some of your belongings via  mail. USPS is an affordable, reliable and fast shipping method. It usually  takes between four to ten days for packages to be delivered from the  continental U.S.  to Hawaii  (via standard shipping).  There are also shipping companies that offer moving to Hawaii services.</p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Shipping a car:</strong> Shipping a car to Hawaii can be arranged with the following shipping companies: Horizon Lines, Matson and Pasha Hawaii.  The cost of shipping a car from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii is around $1,100 per  standard vehicle. This rate does not apply to any vehicle exceeding 21'8&quot;  L x 8' W x 7' H, or vehicles which have built-in accommodations for cooking or sleeping.</p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Plants:</strong> Plants can enter Hawaii only after  inspection. If you have plants you want to carry over to Hawaii, contact the U.S Department of  Agriculture for more information. Here is their address: Animal and Plant  Health Insurance Service, Terminal Box 57, Honolulu International   Airport, Honolulu, Hawaii   96819.</p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Pets:</strong> Hawaii is very strict when it comes to  importing pets. The first thing you should do in order to import a pet into the  state of Hawaii  is to contact the Hawaii Department of Agriculture at least 4 months prior to moving.  They will provide you with the necessary information and instruction. For more  information, please visit <a href="http://hdoa.hawaii.gov" target="_blank">http://hdoa.hawaii.gov</a>.</p>
              <h2><br />
                Living in Hawaii and Housing Cost</h2>
              <p> To rent a place in Hawaii  is significantly more expensive than in most places on the U.S. mainland. A  studio on Oahu, for example, costs anywhere  from $800-$1,200+ per month, depending on the location. A two-bedroom apartment  or a house typically starts from $1,800 per month and up. Luxurious newly-built one-bedroom condos typically rent for $3,000 and up.</p>
              <p> When looking at the average wage people make in Hawaii, it is clear that it falls far short  of the average wage required to rent a two-bedroom apartment, according to 2016 data made available by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Hawaii is currently $1,780. To be able to afford this rent without paying more than 30% of income on housing, a household has to earn $5,932 per month or $71,184 per year. Assuming a 40-hour work week, 52 weeks per year, this level of income translates into a hourly Housing Wage of $34.22 per hour.</p>
              <p>This U.S. map below shows the hourly wage a household must earn in 2015 (working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year) in order to afford the Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment without paying more than 30% of their income, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Hawaii ranks No. 1 in the United States in housing costs (housing wage of $31.61 per hour).</p>
              <p><img src="images/us-housing-map.jpg" width="100%" alt="US Housing Cost Map" /></p>
              <p>The estimated hourly mean renter wage in Hawaii is $14.53 in 2016. So assuming a 40-hour work week, a household must include 2.2 workers earning the mean renter wage in order to afford a Fair Market Rent two-bedroom apartment. The figure below lists the average fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment, the hourly mean renter wage
                
                and the household income needed to afford a fair market rent two-bedroom apartment.</p>

              <p> According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there are 43% of renter households in Hawaii (2010-2014). Buying a house is beyond the reach for many people and often times  so is renting an apartment. That's why many local families share a house or apartment  with their extended family. Singles may choose to share an apartment with one  or several roommates. And then there are the many homeless. Statewide, between  12,000 and 15,000 people are homeless in Hawaii  at some point of the year and at least 6,000 are homeless on any given day,  according to the Hawaii H.O.M.E. Project. In Hawaii there are currently 487 homeless per 100,000 people, which is the highest rate per capita in the United States, above New York and Nevada according to federal statistics. </p>
              <p><strong>Hawaii Unemployment Rates by County</strong></p>
<p>The statewide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Hawaii was 2.7% in March 2017 (compared to 4.5% in the U.S.), according to the Hawaii State Department of Labor &amp; Industrial Relations (DLIR). In March 2017, there were 677,700 people employed in Hawaii and 19,100 people who were unemployed.</p>

              <p><strong>Cost of Food</strong></p>
              <p> Although about 90% of all food in Hawaii  is imported and things cost more here than on the U.S. mainland, you can buy food at relatively  affordable prices at chains like Costco, WalMart and Sam's Club. Some regular  supermarkets also have special sales. A good idea for staying within your  budget is to buy what's on sale, not what you want to eat. If you like dining  outside, things can add up quickly. The average cost for a breakfast in Hawaii is from about $4  to $7, for lunch from about $5 to $10 and for dinner about $12 to $30 and more.</p>
              <h3>Living in Waikiki</h3>
              <p> Waikiki is well-known among visitors to Hawaii and many of the  buildings here are actually hotels. If you choose to live in Waikiki,  you will be close to Waikiki   Beach and Diamond Head. If you are into nightlife, Waikiki is a perfect place to live. Waikiki has nightclubs, restaurants, shows, bars and much more. A disadvantage of  living in Waikiki is that there is only one  grocery store (called Food Pantry), which is also very expensive. The only  other place you can buy food at are the ABC Stores, which are also expensive  and limited when it comes to groceries. However, ABC Stores are easy to find, since they  are located all over Waikiki.</p>
              <p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Public bus:</strong> On Oahu, the public bus transportation system is  conveniently called TheBus. It is an affordable ($2.50 per ticket) and  convenient way to get around on the island. There are many bus routes that  cover most areas of Oahu. For more  information about the cost of a ticket, routes and schedules, visit www.thebus.org. On Maui, there is the Maui Bus. The fare is $1 per boarding.  For routes and schedules, visit www.co.maui.hi.us.  The Kauai Bus offers public transportation on Kauai.  Visit www.kauai.gov for more info. And on  the Big Island, there is Hele-On Bus, www.heleonbus.org. On Molokai, MEO (Maui Economic Opportunity) offers a Rural Shuttle Service at no cost. Visit meoinc.charityfinders.org/Transportation for more info. There are no public  transportation services on the island of Lanai.</p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Taxi:</strong> Taxi services are available  on all islands. </p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Traffic:</strong> Traffic is a real problem  on the island of Oahu. Rush hour is early in the morning  between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. and in the afternoon between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. </p>
              <p><strong class="subtitle">Parking:</strong> Parking is one of the  main transportation issues on the island   of Oahu. If you work in downtown  Honolulu or in Waikiki, it is highly recommended that you rent a parking  spot on a monthly basis in case your company does not provide one.</p>
